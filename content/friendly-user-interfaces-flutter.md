Creating user-friendly interfaces in Flutter is crucial for retaining users and enhancing usability. Utilizing Flutter's rich set of widgets and material design principles can help developers build intuitive and responsive interfaces. It's important to consider factors such as layout, color schemes, and typography when designing the UI.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('User-friendly UI')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Welcome to my Flutter app!')),
    );
  }
}
```
