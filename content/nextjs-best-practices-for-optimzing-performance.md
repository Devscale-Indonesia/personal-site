Optimizing performance in Next.js applications is crucial for providing a smooth user experience. By implementing best practices, developers can ensure that their applications load quickly and run efficiently. Techniques such as code splitting, optimizing images, and using server-side rendering can significantly enhance the performance of your Next.js app.

```javascript
// Example of dynamic import for code splitting
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import("./DynamicComponent"));

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello Next.js</h1>
      <DynamicComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
```
